# TheBankSmartContract
My first smart contract that I wrote without support from anywhere. The person who deploys the contract becomes the bankOwner. The money deposited by each address is recorded into mapping. Each user can withdraw the amount he deposited. withdrawn money is deducted from the balance. When he tries to withdraw more money, he gets an error. If the person who withdraws money is the owner of the bank, he does not need to have money in his account, he can withdraw the money in the bank in any amount he wants.Investors can send the money in their accounts to other accounts. They pay a 5% commission on the amount of money they send.
